[Self-learning notes](https://nlyu1.github.io/blockchain-notes){:target="_blank"} (in progress) for blockchain, following Tim Roughgarden's graduate course [Foundations of Blockchains](https://timroughgarden.github.io/fob21/). 

Highlights of the course: 

1. Placeholder. 

Nontrivial theorems:

1. Dolev-Strong protocol: synchronous Byzantine broadcast with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is solvable with arbitrary number of Byzantine nodes. 
2. FLM (Fischer, Lynch, Merritt)-impossibility result: synchronous Byzantine broadcast with $f\geq n/3$ and no PKI is unsolvable.

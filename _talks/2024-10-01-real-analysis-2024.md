[Course notes](https://nlyu1.github.io/real-analysis/) (in progress) of Harvard *Math 114* '24, taught by Kevin Yang. 

I'm taking this course to develop the mathematical foundation needed for a rigorous understanding of information theory and for working with infinite-dimensional systems in the future. The study of infinite-dimensional and bounded operators is also particularly relevant to quantum theory. Contents include: 

1. Lebesgue theory (Rudin *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* Ch. 11); convergence and approximation theorems (). 
2. $$L_p$$ spaces (Lieb and Loss, Ch. 2).

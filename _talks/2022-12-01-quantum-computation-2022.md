[Course notes](https://github.com/nlyu1/Fall-2024/tree/main/Misc/Quantum%20Computing%20Notes) for MIT 8.371 (Fall 2022, Peter Shor), a introductory graduate course in quantum computation. Features the basics of quantum circuits, Grover and Shor's algorithms, quantum channels and error-correction. 

This course is my introduction to quantum mechanics; it is solely responsible for pivoting my interest from machine learning to physics. These notes closely follow Nielson and Chuang's *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information*: 

1. Linear algebra, basics of quantum mechanics. 
2. Qubits, bloch sphere, and basics of reversible computation. 
3. Quantum circuits. 
4. Quantum algorithms: Deusch-Josza, Grover, and Shor's algorithms. 
5. Quantum channels and error-correction.

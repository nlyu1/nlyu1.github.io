Course notes for MIT 8.3710(Fall 2022, Peter Shor), a introductory graduate course in quantum computation. Features the basics of quantum circuits, Grover and Shor's algorithms, quantum channels and error-correction. 

This course is my introduction to quantum mechanics; it is pivotal for pivoting my interest from machine learning to physics. These earlier notes (written in Pages) closely follow Nielson and Chuang's *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information*: 

1. [Linear algebra, basics of quantum mechanics](/files/quantum_computation/0.pdf). 
2. [Qubits, bloch sphere, and basics of reversible computation](/files/quantum_computation/1.pdf). 
3. [Quantum circuits](/files/quantum_computation/2.pdf): local decomposition of quantum unitaries, and the $$H, T$$-approximation. 
4. [Quantum algorithms](/files/quantum_computation/3.pdf): Deusch-Josza, Grover, and Shor's algorithms. 
5. [Quantum channels, error-correction](/files/quantum_computation/8.pdf).

Comprehensive [course notes](https://nlyu1.github.io/classical-info-theory) (in progress) for MIT 6.370 *Information Theory: from Coding to Learning*, 
taught by (Fall 2024, [Yury Polyanskiy](https://people.lids.mit.edu/yp/homepage/))
This is a fast-paced, graduate-level modern treatment of information theory. 

Highlights of the course: 

1. Fundamental properties of information measures (e.g. entropy, divergence, mutual information, Fisher information): non-negativity, monotonicity, and data-processing inequality (convexity). 
2. Divergence as a fundamental concept, f-divergences. 
3. Convexity of information measures correpond to important **variational characterizations**, which yield tractable bounds and approximations. 

Nontrivial theorems:

1. Golden formula: variational characterization of mutual information. 
2. Donsker-Varadhan, and generalized variational characterization of f-divergences.
3. Local $$\chi^2$$ behavior of f-divergences, and Fisher behavior of regular parameterized families. 
4. Harremoës-Vadja: one theorem to rule them all f-divergence joint range. 
5. Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins (HCR) Cramér-Rao lower bound; van Trees inequality.

Based on MacLane and Birkhoff's *Algebra*, these notes cover topics roughly equivalent to a one-semester undergraduate course on group and ring theory. 

One of my favorite textbooks in algebra, *Algebra* offers a structured and cohesive exposition by connects algebraic constructions (such as quotients, kernels, and freely generated objects) through the language of category theory. The notes 

1. Groups (Ch. 2, 7): isomorphism theorems, Sylow theorems, simplicity of alternating groups. 
2. Rings (Ch. 3): ideals, polynomials and unique factorization, integral domains and fields. 
3. Universal constructions (Ch. 4, 15): categorical aspects of algebraic structures, focusing on universality and functors. Hom-functors and representations, contravariance and duality. 
4. Multilinear algebra (Ch. 16) is covered in (miscellaneous notes)[placeholder].

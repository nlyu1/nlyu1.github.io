Self-study notes on MacLane and Birkhoff's *Algebra*. These notes cover topics roughly equivalent to a one-semester undergraduate course on group and ring theory. 

One of my favorite textbooks in algebra, *Algebra* offers a structured and cohesive exposition by connects algebraic constructions (such as quotients, kernels, and freely generated objects) through the language of category theory.

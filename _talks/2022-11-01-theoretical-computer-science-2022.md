[Course notes](https://nlyu1.github.io/files/CS121-Notes.pdf){:target="_blank"} for Harvard *CS 121: Theoretical Computer Science* (Fall 2022, Boaz Barak). Provides foundational knowledge in computability and complexity, as well as strong intuitions on computational models and fundamental limits of computation; my favorite computer science course at Harvard.

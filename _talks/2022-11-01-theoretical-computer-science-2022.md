[Course notes](https://nlyu1.github.io/files/CS121-Notes.pdf){:target="_blank"} for Harvard *CS 121: Theoretical Computer Science* (Fall 2022, Boaz Barak). Provides foundational knowledge in computability and complexity, as well as strong intuitions on computational models and fundamental limits of computation; my favorite computer science course at Harvard. 

1. Computational models: circuits, regular expressions, context-free grammars, and Turing machines; standard Turing-equivalence reductions ($$\lambda$$-calculus, finite automata, etc). 
2. Regex-DFA equivalence: single-pass constant-memory algorithms. 
3. Rice's theorem: nontrivial semantic functions are uncomputable. This is the price of universality! 
4. Proof as computation: GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem.

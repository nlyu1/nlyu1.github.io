Course notes of Harvard *Physics 143b: Quantum Mechanics II*
Fall '23, taught by Sonia Paban. Many constructions were 
later much better understood after taking [classical mechanics](https://nlyu1.github.io/knowledge-base/2024-01-02-classical-mechanics-2024). 

Quantum mechanics II focuses on the physical applications of 
quantum theory. Main contents include: 

1. Path integrals. 
2. Symmetry, conservation laws, and selection rules. 
3. Perturbation theory (time-dependent and time-independent). 
4. Hydrogen atom: fine and hyperfine splitting. 
5. WKB approximation. 
6. Scattering.

This work is inspired by our previous work on [fermionic convolution](/publication/2024-09-12-fermionic-gaussian-testing). 
We found that fermionic convolution retains desirable properties *only for a subclass of special **even** quantum states*. 
The even constraint also makes the math much easier work with, and previous works on fermionic Gaussian theory has predominantly focused on the zero-mean (even) case.  

<span style="color: #6A8EAE;">Many important questions are not well understood about the general displaced Gaussian states.</span> We were originally motivated to answer them to obtain a general theory of fermionic convolution, but the study itself was bulky enough to warrant this separate work. **The following motivating questions are answered** in [this work](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18517):

1. How to describe <u>the action of displaced fermionic unitaries</u>? 
2. Zero-mean Gaussian states have a nice unified characterization from physical, computational, and Fourier perspectives. <u>Do displaced Gaussian states have the same coherent definition?</u>
3. The physical transformations of zero-mean fermionic Gaussian unitaries correspond to computational circuits of nearest-neighbor matchgates. <u>What circuits to displaced Gaussian unitaries correspond to?</u>
4. Can they be efficiently classically simulated, and how? 
5. How to build a bridge between results which work for even operators (e.g. fermionic convolution) and the general case without parity constraint?

Building on a Lie algebra reduction identified by Knill in 2001, we obtain the following results in response to the questions above: 

1. The extra mean of the fermionic Gaussian unitary *effectively acts as covariance on one more mode*. 
2. Displaced Gaussian states have a unified characterization from physical, computational, and Fourier perspectives, generalizing the even Gaussian case. 
3. Displaced Gaussian unitaries are equivalent to nearest-neighbor matchgates *plus arbitrary single-qubit gate on the first line*.
4. Efficient simulation can be conducted using Grassmann Gaussian integral overlap. 
5. We proposed a unitary embedding of displaced Gaussian states and unitaries into even Gaussian counterparts. 

Apart from its immediate contribution to fermionic Gaussian theory, 
this work sheds light on how super-selection constraints presents themselves mathematically through commutativity requirements, and provides one valuable example to generalize the existing theory beyond the parity constraint. <span style="color: #6A8EAE;">The fermionic example is an important case-study for the more general Gaussian theories of parafermions, or even abelian and non-abelian anyons we wish to later pursue. </span>

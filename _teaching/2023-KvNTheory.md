The motivation for this [final project](/files/Phy_151_Final_Project.pdf){:target="_blank"} is the adjoint problem of Hamiltonian mechanics: understanding how the evolution of a subsystem can be used to infer properties of the composite system. The goal is  characterizing dynamical closures—the extension of subsystem dynamics into the Hamiltonian dynamics of a larger system. <u>This problem is not solved by this project</u>. However, the steps towards solving this problem provided insights into the relation between kinematics and dynamics, as well as the boundary between classical and quantum theories. 

Main takeaways: 

1. <u>Koopman von Neumann theory</u>: reinterpreting classical dynamics within Hilbert spaces to explore analogies with quantum systems; this perspective highlights the role of noncommutative observables in quantum theory. 
2. <u>Stinespring's dilation theorem</u>: establishes the feasibility of snapshot closures for classical systems, using the similar result from quantum theory (at the cost of dilating to $$n^2$$ degrees of freedom); the remaining problem is assembling possible dilations into a canonical transformation. 
3. Numerical exploration of the coupled harmonic oscillator, and intuition into how the dynamics of one oscillator relates to the full system's evolution.

I am a senior pursuing a degree in physics with computer science secondary at Harvard university. 

Organization
======

1. [Theoretical research](/publications): overview of my research publications. 
2. [Experimental projects](/projects): summary of my hands-on experience in quantum experimentation. 
3. [Notes and teaching materials](/talks): a collection of my notes from coursework, self-study, and teaching assistance; they offer a growing set of tools for tackling research problems. 
4. [CV](/files/XLyu_Resume_1110.pdf): detailed contents can all be found on this site. 

Research interest
======

I'm interested in the intersection of physics and computing, which leads naturally to the study of quantum computation and information. I wish to explore the theoretical underpinnings and the experimental realization of quantum computational systems.

- My [theoretical research](/publications) investigates the classical-quantum boundary in computational systems. A central perspective is the *necessity and sufficiency of Gaussianity for the classical simulability* of both fermionic and bosonic quantum systems; this also highlights the deep connection between simulability and the structure of quantum phase space. 
- My [experimental experience](/projects/experiment) focuses on the practical aspects of quantum computation. Working in a neutral atom array lab provided me with firsthand experience in organizing well-understood physical tools—such as lasers and atom-light interactions—with classical control systems to facilitate quantum computation.

Education background 
======

My interest in the physicality of computation began with coursework in theoretical computer science, systems, and compiler design. This background inspired a shift toward physics, leading me to pursue the standard physics curriculum and, in addition, mathematical physics, information theory, and quantum computation. My background in these subjects (links to notes):

Table of contents

1. See (link) for a list (one so far) of my preprints, their summary, and how they relate to my research interests. 
2. See (projects) for my experimental research experience in experimental physics-neutral atom array-and other offshoot projects. 
3. I am an avid learner and note-taker. See notes (link) for a list of course and self-study notes. 

<!-- Test Section
------
This site is currently under maintenance. -->

Todo list: 

1. Bozen: change (active research, past research projects) to (research, projects) and update the links above. 
2. Bozen: tell Nicholas how to embed notes in the webpage [reference](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/embed-pdf-in-github-pages/4527). Do the one for "statistical inference" as an example; this can also reference the template for "active research"
3. Bozen (will be good to have but not necessary):find a hyperlink reference way to open a page (e.g. link to notes) in a new page instead. 
4. Nicholas: update links to: 
   - QMII
   - Quantum information
   - Theoretical computer science
5. Update latest version of Miscellaneous notes (pdf).
